    "markdownContent": "## Cloud-Native Application\n\nThe application is developed as a **RESTful API** using **Node.js** and **Prisma**, featuring endpoints for user management and health checks. Prisma, acting as an ORM, ensures efficient database interactions. This setup provides a robust backend capable of handling high loads while maintaining performance and security.\n\n- **Node.js** enables asynchronous operations, enhancing the API's responsiveness.\n- The API design adheres to best practices, ensuring **scalability** and **maintainability**, crucial for cloud-native applications.\n\n\n\n## Infrastructure Automation\n\n**Terraform** automates resource provisioning, ensuring consistency and version control across the infrastructure. **Packer** creates custom machine images, incorporating all necessary configurations and dependencies.\n\n- This automation reduces manual intervention, minimizes errors, and accelerates deployment processes.\n- By defining **infrastructure as code**, the project achieves repeatability and scalability, essential for managing complex cloud environments.\n\n\n\n## Event-Driven Architecture\n\nUtilizing **Google Pub/Sub** for messaging and user notifications allows the application to handle real-time events efficiently. This decouples system components, enhancing scalability and fault tolerance.\n\n- **Pub/Sub** supports asynchronous communication, ensuring the application can manage high-throughput scenarios and provide timely updates to users.\n- This architecture is vital for maintaining responsiveness under varying load conditions.\n\n\n\n## Monitoring and Logging\n\n**GCP's Operations Suite** provides robust monitoring and logging, offering insights and alerts to maintain system health and performance.\n\n- **Cloud Monitoring** tracks metrics and sends alerts for unusual activity.\n- **Cloud Logging** collects and analyzes logs, aiding in troubleshooting and performance optimization.\n\nThis comprehensive visibility ensures **proactive maintenance** and swift issue resolution.\n\n\n\n## Security\n\nSecurity is a priority, with **customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK)** enhancing data protection.\n\n- CMEK allows precise control over encryption keys, ensuring data security and compliance with regulatory standards.\n- This approach safeguards data at rest and in transit, aligning with best practices in cloud security.\n\nRegular **key rotations** and strict **access controls** further enhance security measures.\n\n\n\n## Scalability and Performance\n\n**Load balancing** and **autoscaling** maintain application performance and availability.\n\n- **GCP's Load Balancing** service distributes traffic across instances, preventing bottlenecks.\n- **Autoscaling** dynamically adjusts the number of instances based on demand, optimizing resource utilization and cost efficiency.\n\nThis ensures the application remains responsive under varying loads.\n\n\n\n## Continuous Deployment\n\n**Continuous deployment** practices ensure seamless updates through rolling updates in managed instance groups. **CI/CD pipelines** automate build, test, and deployment processes, enabling frequent, reliable releases.\n\n- Rolling updates minimize downtime by incrementally deploying new versions.\n- This approach maintains application integrity and user experience during updates.\n\n\n\nFor more detailed information on this project, please visit the [Github Code](#).",

      "markdownContent": "## Bike Sharing Demand Prediction\n\nThis project utilizes **H2O AutoML** to predict daily bike rental counts, focusing on model accuracy and feature interpretability. Excluding ensemble models, the analysis uses **SHAP** and **LIME** to understand key drivers of bike rentals.\n\n### AutoML Process\n- **H2O AutoML** was employed to automatically train multiple models such as **Random Forest**, **Linear Regression**, and **XGBoost**.\n- The goal was to predict the total daily bike rentals based on features like **temperature**, **humidity**, and **seasonality**.\n\n### Feature Engineering and Data Preprocessing\n- The dataset was preprocessed with **one-hot encoding** applied to categorical variables, while numerical features were already normalized.\n- Features include **season**, **year**, **month**, **holiday status**, **weather conditions**, and normalized **temperature**, **humidity**, and **windspeed**.\n\n### Results and Metrics\n- The **Random Forest** model outperformed other models with the following metrics:\n  - **R²**: 0.87\n  - **MAE**: 471\n  - **RMSE**: 716\n- **Linear Regression** achieved:\n  - **R²**: 0.84\n  - **MAE**: 583\n  - **RMSE**: 722\n- **Temperature**, **year**, and **humidity** were identified as the most important factors influencing bike rental demand.\n\n### Model Interpretability\n- **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** analysis revealed:\n  - **Year (yr_1)**, **temperature (temp)**, and **feeling temperature (atemp)** had the highest impact on rental counts.\n  - **SHAP values** were used to explain how individual predictions were made, providing insights into how feature values contributed to the overall rental predictions.\n\n### Data Visualization\n- Histograms and count plots were used to explore the distribution of bike rentals and feature values.\n  - **Temperature** and **working days** were found to significantly influence the number of rentals, with moderate temperatures correlating with higher rentals.\n\n### Limitations\n- **H2O AutoML's** inability to compute SHAP values for ensemble models led to the exclusion of these models to maintain interpretability.\n- The focus remained on simpler models like **Random Forest** and **Linear Regression** for transparent analysis.\n\nFor more information, visit the [Github Repository](#)."
